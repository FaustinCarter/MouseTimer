</blockquote>
<p class="topic">Enable file versions</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style4">What is file versions function for?</p>
  <p>Enabling file versions function can help you keep the history editions of the same file.</p>
  <p>After the first-time backup completes, all backed-up files will be stored in the ''latest'' folder in the backup destination. From the next backup, Data Replicator 3 will automatically check if any file with the same file name already exists in the "latest" folder. If there is and content of files has changed, the previous backed-up file in the "latest" folder will then be moved to the "past" folder as an older version, whereas the file on your computer will be backed up to the "latest" folder, where you can always find all the latest backed-up files there.</p>
  <p class="notehead">Note:</p>
  <p class="notecontent">The referred file above must be in the same folder. So when you're using the same account to back up the folder, there will be past version generated.</p>
  <p>When the file version function is enabled, and you experienced improper and irreversible editing on your local files, you can find the history files in the backup destination and restore files easily.</p>
  <p><b>Number of past versions</b></p>
  <p>You can set here how many past versions of backup files you wish to keep, 20 versions are the maximum. The file name of past version files will be added with "v00", "v01", and so on. The bigger the number is, the newer version it is.</p>
  <p>Set a number of past versions to decide how many previous versions will be kept in the backup destination. Follow the steps to proceed:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Tick <v>Enable file versions</v>.</li>
<li>Set a number of past versions, and click <b>Apply</b> to save the settings. </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p class="topic">Restore points</p>
<blockquote>
  <p class="style4">What is restore points?</p>
  <p>Every time after backup is performed, there will be a folder named as the backup starting time which contains all files of this backup. That will be a restore point.</p>
  <p>The file which had never been modified will appear in every restore point after each backup. However, only one file disk size is occupied actually.</p>
  <p><b>Number of restore points</b></p>
  <p>You can set here how many restore points you wish to keep, 128 restore points are the maximum. When the restore point number exceeds the set value, the oldest restore points on the backup destination will be automatically deleted after next backup.</p>
